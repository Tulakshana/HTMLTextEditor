Using the backdrop of Uganda, this work reports on a detailed study, of rural users of various information and communications technologies (ICTs). It explores how rural users prioritise various information needs, identifies their current methods of information access, their frequency of information access as well as their satisfaction level with the information that they do receive. The study discusses priorities and gaps in current access to information that may highlight opportunities for mobile applications. The study sample includes an urban component that is used for purposes of contrasting differences between rural and urban information practices as well as exploring the communication linkages that do exist between the two sides.</pre>")
